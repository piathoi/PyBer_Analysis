* The Urban fares started with an average of $1800 with a consistent increase around 2,300.
* The Suburban fares started around $1000, and it was not profitable. Fare dropped in March and in mid-April.
* The Rural fares started at around $200. Fares increased and dropped till the end of April.

## Summary

Urban cities have the highest fares. We can expand more giving the business is thriving there in those areas.
During the month of April, the total fare by each city type seems to increase, especially with those cities in suburban area. The company should research as to why it happended. It seems that the drivers in rural and suburban areas are significantly smaller compare to those in Urban. The company should hire more drivers there to increase profits.
