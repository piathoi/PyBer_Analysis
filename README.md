# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The goal of this week's analysis is find out the total weekly fares for each city type by creating a multiple-line graph. The PyBer company has drivers in three types of cities, which are urban, suburban and rural. During the week, we analyzed the ride count, average number of drivers and fare per ride. In addition, we compared each city's metric and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this final challenge, we created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver as well as the multiple line plot.

## Results

The PyBer summary DataFrames:

From the PyBer summary DataFrames, we can see that the most populated cities, which are in Urban areas, has the most rides and drivers. It shows that business there is thriving. In addition, we can see that there are not much business in Rural and Suburban areas by looking at the Total Rides and Total Drivers. However, the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver seems to be increasing. This trend can be explained by the supply-and-demand theory. When there is more demand, but the supply is low, the price will increase.

A multiple-line chart of totak fares for each city type:

From the multiple-line chart, we can see that all the lines have peaks toward the end of March, especially with Suburban areas. Suburban and Rural lines seem to follow the same trend from March to around the end of April, but Urban line fluctuates around that period.
